# node-termostat
A customised termostat written in NodeJS, having a nice UI leveraging AngularJS&amp;Bootstrap

Warning this is still a work in progress.
Things that are working:
* ui for controlling and reading termostat details
* switching on/off pins

What still needs to be done:
* termostat logic has to be programmed (auto mode)
* user authentication has to be added
* easy web customisation of used pins to switch has to be added
* no idea right now :)
